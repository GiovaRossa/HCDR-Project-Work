- Add at least two custom features to your dataset and evaluate their contribution      OK
- Compare at least two prediction methods, after fine-tuning their parameters           OK
- Investigate instances with almost correct predictions and with completely wrong
predictions. Do they have some peculiarities? Any strange feature distribution?         OK
- Can be done in groups, multiply the work by the size of the group                     OK
- To get a good mark: more prediction methods, not trashing features, external data,
prediction methods not discussed during the curse.                                      BOH
