This is a standard supervised classification task:\n",

    "## Encoding Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, we need to deal with pesky categorical variables.  A machine learning model unfortunately cannot deal with categorical variables (except for some models such as [LightGBM](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Features.html)). Therefore, we have to find a way to encode (represent) these variables as numbers before handing them off to the model. There are two main ways to carry out this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Label encoding**: assign each unique category in a categorical variable with an integer. No new columns are created. An example is shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/label_encoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-hot encoding**: create a **new column for each unique category** in a categorical variable. Each observation recieves a 1 in the column for its corresponding category and a 0 in all other new columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/one_hot_encoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with label encoding is that it gives the categories an arbitrary ordering. The value assigned to each of the categories is **random** and does not reflect any inherent aspect of the category. In the example above, programmer recieves a 4 and data scientist a 1, but if we did the same process again, the labels could be reversed or completely different. The actual assignment of the integers is arbitrary. Therefore, when we perform label encoding, the model might use the relative value of the feature (for example programmer = 4 and data scientist = 1) to assign weights which is not what we want. If we only have two unique values for a categorical variable (such as Male/Female), then label encoding is fine, but for more than 2 unique categories, one-hot encoding is the safe option.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some debate about the relative merits of these approaches, and some models can deal with label encoded categorical variables with no issues. [Here is a good Stack Overflow discussion](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9443/when-to-use-one-hot-encoding-vs-labelencoder-vs-dictvectorizor). One-hot encoding is the safest approach because it does not impose arbitrary values to categories. The only downside to one-hot encoding is that the number of features (dimensions of the data) can explode with categorical variables with many categories. \n",
    "\n",
